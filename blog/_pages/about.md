I'm a junior data scientist with a Masters Degree in Operations Research.
I started building my own Data Science Portfolio after graduating, currently
following [Learn Data Science in 3 Months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rDhY1P3YLA&t=3s) to step up my game!
Although I'm quite certain that 3 months is a bit "enthusiastic", I think it's doable with
my background in Maths and Statistics and already quite familiar with Python.
