Here I will keep a list of all youtube videos, online courses, books, and websites
that have been helpful to me in my Data Science Journey. When I some spare time
I will try to summarize my learnings of each resource in a seperate blog.

## Resources I have finished:

* How to set up my own blog: [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M&t=72s)
This is the youtube video I followed to set up my own blog, shout out
to **DataOptimal** for making a clear introduction on this.
* Extensive pandas tutorial: [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw)
This is a recording of the **best pandas tutorial** by Brandon Rhodes. On my github page
there is a repository with all the data used in the video. I suggest you watch the video,
make the exercises, and continue on to the next section. Later I will create a short blog
to summarize what I've learnt from the video on a different dataset.
* Machine learning online course: [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
This online course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and
statistical pattern recognition. Andrew Ng is an excellent instructor who teaches the
fundaments of machine learning algorithms with Octave. Although I was hesitant at first
using Octave, it was relatively easy to learn. Arguably the **best online course on machine learning**.
* Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners: [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
"This course will give you a full introduction into all of the core concepts in python. Follow along with the videos and you'll be a python programmer in no time!" Honestly, **very** clear explanation of Python concepts.
If you're starting your data science journey, definitely start with this one.
Thanks **freeCodeCamp.org**, you're the best.

## Resources I have yet to start with:
* Extensive scitkit tutorial: [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7R4HUQ-eQ0)
This is a recording of a **scikit tutorial** by Jake Vanderplas.
* Introduction to Python for Data Science: [edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-python-data-science-3)
Suggested by **Siraj Raval**, this courses teaches the basics of numpy/matplotlib/pandas,
the fundamental packages for data science. An overview of learnings from this course
will probably be my first blog post (next to this one...).
